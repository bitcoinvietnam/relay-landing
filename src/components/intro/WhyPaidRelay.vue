      Why should I join a paid Nostr relay?
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you want to get the most out of your Nostr experience, signing up for at least one (or a few) paid relays is a
      must.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relying solely on public relays will make your Nostr experience painfully slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between using paid relays and only using public ones is like comparing internet speeds in 2005 to
      those in 2015.
