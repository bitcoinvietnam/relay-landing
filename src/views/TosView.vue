        Welcome to the BitcoinVN Nostr relay. By using our service, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service

          abusive, or violates the rights of others is strictly prohibited. <strong>Particularly, political content
            related
            to Vietnam that may be deemed sensitive or inappropriate by local authorities can be considered a violation
            of
            these Terms and may result in the immediate termination of the user's access to the service.</strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Conduct:</strong> Engaging in activities that disrupt the relay's functionality or infringe on the
          rights of other users is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, spamming, distributing malware,
          and
          attempting to compromise the security of the service.</li>

        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Users must respect the data and privacy of others. Unauthorized access to
